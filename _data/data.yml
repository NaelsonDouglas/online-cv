  - role: Data Scientist, Tech Leader and Software Engineer
    time: Nov 2019 - Present
    company: Centro de Inovações Edge
    details: |
      This company intermediates most of my projects. It is a R&D focused company which makes possible several projects in the field of machine learning and software engineering. Namely, my projects with Smart, ASUS, General Electric and Compal (all listed below) were made possible through it.

  - role: Data Scientist
    time: Sep 2022 - Dec 2022
    company: Niche Investments
    details: |
      I projected and implemented a machine learning approach capable of automatically detecting relevant parts on the text of online sale listings. These parts were afterwards used as input to the company business model. Based on my previous experience, I was given in this project total liberty and control on the project design decisions. At the current time the implemented model is being prepared for the production final release.
      Tools: Spacy, Heroku, Docker-compose, NLTK, Thefuzz, FastAPI, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pytorch etc

  - role: Data Scientist
    time: Aug 2022 - Dec 2022
    company: Bosch
    details: |
      I was contracted to implement a real-time compliance detection of federal legislation using Natural Language Processing.
      I used a web scraping approach in order to constantly read every newly published federal law. Then I trained a set of models which altogether were capable of identifying if the company is being compliant to these newly created legislation. On top of these models I built a fully fledged system capable of alerting the parts of interest about legislation changes, allowing them to take the needed actions.
      Tools: Beautiful Soup, Spacy, MLFlow, SqlAlchemy, Docker-compose, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pytorch etc

  - role: Data Science Tech Leader
    time: Mar 2021 - Present
    company: General Electric
    details: |
      My goal was to build an automatic comprehension of unstructured technical documents in order to extract equipment specifications and offer sales recommendations.
      Here I implemented a series of rule-based models capable of detecting the description of technical specifications of a set of medical equipment on auction orders. Using the collected specifications, I then implemented a recommendation system capable of automatically indicating which machine can be sold to the specific auction. Several other auxiliary models were also implemented, for example, a fuzzy matcher capable of visually indicating the location of the features within the documents, as well an OCR based text extractor interface for the final user. This is by far the largest project I've worked on.
      Tools: Spacy, Displacy, Fuzzy matching, Structural Pattern matching, Parsing-three based matcher, Token sequence based matcher, Docker, Docker-compose, Pytest, Pandas etc

  - role: Data Scientist
    time: Aug 2020 - May 2022
    company: Asus
    details: |
      I worked on a project where a set of web crawlers were used to collect user feedback from social media. These feedbacks were then processed in a manner to detect their opinion regarding the company.
      Tools: BERT, HuggingFace, Keras, Twitter API, Youtube API, Spacy, Django, Docker-compose, Pandas, Pytorch etc

  - role: Scientific Researcher
    time: Jul 2015 - Jul 2018
    company: Universidade Federal de Alagoas
    details: |
      I participated in several researches on the field of data processing. More specifically researches on the field of polarimetric image processing using distributed computing on top of the programming language Julia, as well medical image imaging using convolutional neural networks.
      Tools: Julia, Python, R, Pytorch, AWS, Linux etc
